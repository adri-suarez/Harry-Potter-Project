        <h1>J. K. Rowling</h1>Joanne "Jo" Rowling (born in Yate, United Kingdom,
        July 31, 1965), better known as J. K. Rowling, is the British author of
        the fantasy story of Harry Potter, the orphan boy wizard. She was born
        in Chipping Sodburry, South Gloucestershire.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her publisher, Bloomsbury, wanted her to use her initials on the cover
        of the Harry Potter books, stating that a female name on the cover would
        attract less interest from boys, so she decided to use her paternal
        grandmother's name "Kathleen".
        <br />
        <br />
        In February 2004, Forbes magazine reported Rowling's fortune at Â£576
        million, making her the first person to become a millionaire by writing
        books. She is the richest woman in the United Kingdom, and much richer
        than Queen Elizabeth II.

        The writer was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord in 2003.

        Fans of the Harry Potter series are called PotterHeads. Rowling has
        written The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Fantastic Animals and Where to
        Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages that complement the Harry
        Potter series. At first only 7 handmade copies of The Tales of Beedle
        the Bard had been made, 6 sold and one auctioned, all the money was
        donated to charity, but then Rowling decided to publish it to allocate
        the money raised from all the copies sold to charity, this project she
        carried out with the Baroness of England.

        <h1>Harry Potter</h1>Harry James Potter (b. July 31, 1980), is a
        half-blood wizard and the only son of James and Lily Potter. He is the
        only person known to have survived the Avada Kedavra curse, doing so
        twice. Both times the curse was conjured by Lord Voldemort. The first,
        in an attempt to kill Harry as a baby, leads to Voldemort's first defeat
        and the end of the First Magical War. The second, (in which unlike the
        first Voldemort manages to kill him effectively but then the child
        revives) destroys one more part of Voldemort's soul and leads to his
        ultimate destruction and the end of the Second Wizarding War.
        <br />
        <br />
        After his first assassination attempt and the death of his parents,
        Harry is taken in by his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He begins
        attending Hogwarts and is selected for Gryffindor House. He becomes best
        friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the youngest Quidditch
        player in over a century. He becomes even better known in his first
        years after protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and saving
        Ginny Weasley from the Chamber of Secrets. In his fourth year, he wins
        the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ends in tragedy with
        the death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. In the
        following school year, he founds Dumbledore's Army and fights in the
        Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he loses his
        godfather, who was like a father to him.
        <br />
        <br />
        He plays an important role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding
        War. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he encounters Voldemort and
        sacrifices himself, although he does not die, but duels Voldemort for
        the last time and defeats him.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the war, he becomes an auror and marries Ginny Weasley, with whom
        he has three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. He is
        the godfather of Teddy Remus Lupin. Harry is also notable for being the
        only known Lord of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows.
        Paradoxically, he is related to Lord Voldemort, Voldemort being
        descended from Cadmus Peverell and Harry from Ignotus Peverell.
        According to a leaked alternate epilogue written by J.K. Rowling, Harry
        is 150 years old and is headmaster of Hogwarts and has a
        great-great-grandson named Tom, like Tom Ryddle (he might be named Tom
        Potter).
