        <p><h1>Harry Potter</h1>Harry James Potter (b. July 31, 1980), is a half-blood wizard and the only son of James and Lily Potter. He is the only person known to have survived the Avada Kedavra curse, doing so twice. Both times the curse was conjured by Lord Voldemort. The first, in an attempt to kill Harry as a baby, leads to Voldemort's first defeat and the end of the First Magical War. The second, (in which unlike the first Voldemort manages to kill him effectively but then the child revives) destroys one more part of Voldemort's soul and leads to his ultimate destruction and the end of the Second Wizarding War.<br/><br/>

After his first assassination attempt and the death of his parents, Harry is taken in by his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.
<br/><br/>
At the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He begins attending Hogwarts and is selected for Gryffindor House. He becomes best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the youngest Quidditch player in over a century. He becomes even better known in his first years after protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and saving Ginny Weasley from the Chamber of Secrets. In his fourth year, he wins the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ends in tragedy with the death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. In the following school year, he founds Dumbledore's Army and fights in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he loses his godfather, who was like a father to him.
<br/><br/>
He plays an important role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he encounters Voldemort and sacrifices himself, although he does not die, but duels Voldemort for the last time and defeats him.
<br/><br/>
After the war, he becomes an auror and marries Ginny Weasley, with whom he has three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. He is the godfather of Teddy Remus Lupin. Harry is also notable for being the only known Lord of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows. Paradoxically, he is related to Lord Voldemort, Voldemort being descended from Cadmus Peverell and Harry from Ignotus Peverell. According to a leaked alternate epilogue written by J.K. Rowling, Harry is 150 years old and is headmaster of Hogwarts and has a great-great-grandson named Tom, like Tom Ryddle (he might be named Tom Potter).</p>
